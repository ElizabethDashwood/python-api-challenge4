## Module 6 Homework python-api-challenge
### Description:
This is the Module 6 Homework python-api-challenge for using api calls to the OpenWeatherMap API and the Geoapify API. These are used alongside the citipy Python library(https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citipy), as well as matplotlib and hvplot libraries.

### Getting started:
This challenge has 1 project called: WeatherPy containing two starter_code ipynb files called WeatherPy.ipynb and VacationPy.ipynb. Input data is sourced from the OpenWeatherMap API (https://openweathermap.org/api) and the Geoapify API (https://api.geoapify.com/v2/places) sites.

### Installations required:
These projects have been run in a Windows 11 GitBash environment, using Python 3.10.13 together with Jupyter Lab as the editor

### Executing Homework Challenge Requirements:
Please see WeatherPy.ipynb and VacationPy.ipynb for the scripts which perform all code requirements of the project, and include analysis of results in the WeatherPy.ipynb file.  The output_data folder stores the cities.csv file output from the WeatherPy.ipynb file, and has a copy of all plots and maps output in the results of this challenge.
